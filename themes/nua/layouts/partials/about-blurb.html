    <h2>Front-end</h2>
    
    <p>I deliver performant, maintainable, and scalable front-end code through the use of custom-made pattern libraries, well-structured CSS, and robust tooling. This helps drive consistency, predictability, and rapid prototyping when working on a large project.</p>

    <h2>Back-end</h2>
    
    <p>I have many years of experience with various PHP-based content management systems such as WordPress, Craft CMS, and ExpressionEngine. I'm also familiar with WordPress plugin development, and custom applications with Laravel. I use services such as Netlify, Heroku, and DigitalOcean for deploying projects.</p>

  <li>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    
    <p>I build applications with Vue.js and React, and couple these with the front-end skills in the production of pattern libraries and clean code, and wire them up to content management systems and bespoke applications.</p>
