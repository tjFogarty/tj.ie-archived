After hearing a bit about Svelte, I thought I'd give it a go with something small. I saw CodePen had a json feed for job postings, so I figured I'd wrap a bit of sugar around it.

I used the same colour scheme from CodePen, and by default sorted them by featured. You can search on the job titles, and show remote-only positions.

After this, I'm interested in exploring Svelte a bit more to make my articles a bit more interactive.
