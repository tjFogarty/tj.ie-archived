Working with the delightful Chris Coyier I wrote an article for CSS-Tricks. It's a highlight in my life on the web for sure. I pitched a couple of ideas and we settled on writing about a WordPress plugin that changed how I worked, <a href="https://timber.github.io/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Timber</a>. It lets you build your site with the Twig templating language.

It's also <a href="https://github.com/timber/timber#helpful-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked to on the repos page</a>.
