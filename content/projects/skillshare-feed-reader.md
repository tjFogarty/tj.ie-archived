I made a video class on Skillshare for creating an RSS feed reader with Vue.js, and Node with Netlify to make use of their functions to deploy to AWS Lambda.

It took about a week to make and was my first foray into the world of video lessons. It was a pretty interesting experience, and something I may explore more of in the future.
