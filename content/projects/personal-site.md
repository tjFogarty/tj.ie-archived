This is my old personal site built on Craft CMS. It's no longer maintained as I've moved to a static site which I'm planning to make freely available when I've worked everything out with it.

Typically with personal projects like this I try incorporate new things I've learned, and it's usually a place to test out new things. I used DigitalOcean for hosting, and Laravel Forge for quick deployments which was triggered by any pushes to the master branch on GitHub.

For the front-end I used webpack 4 with code splitting and a service worker to keep things quick. I used vanilla JavaScript and Less as a CSS pre-processor along with Tailwind for styling.
