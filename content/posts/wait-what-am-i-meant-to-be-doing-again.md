<p>I’m not primarily a JavaScript Developer - I’m more used to Front-end Development and the tooling scene that has grown with it. Coupled with that I’ve been building websites using WordPress and, for the past 7 months, ExpressionEngine.</p>
<p>Skills on the web atrophy quite quickly, so I’ve been spending some spare time touching up on what I think will be relevant in the years to come. It’s a requirement of the trade, really, otherwise you run the risk of using the modern-day equivalent of table-based layouts.</p>
<p>This can be frustrating as you have to be willing to throw out what you spent all those months, or even years, learning, but it’s also a fantastic opportunity.</p>

<p>I’ve been shying away from JavaScript because it’s a mental block for me. Here’s my process:</p>

<ul><li>
<code>bower install</code> that shit.</li><li>Mess with some boilerplate to build a controller.</li><li>Marvel at the wonder of data-binding.</li><li>I’m a rockstar, this is easy.</li><li>What’s a service?</li><li>What’s a factory?</li><li>When should I use one or the other? Or at all?</li><li>I’m out.</li></ul>
