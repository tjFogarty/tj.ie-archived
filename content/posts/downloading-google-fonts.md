A tool I use a lot is {{< external-link href="https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts" >}}Google Webfonts Helper{{< / external-link >}}. I download the fonts and host them myself, which I kinda like cause I have more control over the files. Part of my webpack setup involves creating a service worker, so it's minimal effort to add them in there.

I was doing this before Google allowed you to use `font-display`, so there was that advantage for a while.

I can use `rel="preload"` as well to help speed things up:

{{< highlight html >}}
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/pt-sans-v10-latin-regular.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/pt-serif-v10-latin-700.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/pt-serif-v10-latin-regular.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
{{< / highlight >}}

10/10 from me. {{< external-link href="https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper" >}}You can see the source and contribute on GitHub.{{< / external-link >}}
