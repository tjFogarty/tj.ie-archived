<p>I often find myself browsing plugins for Craft, and wanted a little resource where I could do just that searching a name, or sorting by downloads and GitHub stars.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s built with Vue, and uses the <a href="https://packagist.org/apidoc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Packagist API</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/tjFogarty/craft-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browse the source</a>, or <a href="https://codepen.io/tjFogarty/project/full/ZdYLPK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see the demo</a>.</p>
