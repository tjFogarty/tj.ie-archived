<p>Recently, I was contacted by the folks at Skillshare to create a class. I&#8217;ve never done videos before, and really dislike hearing my own voice, but I was interested in giving it a go.</p>
<p>They were very helpful in getting me set up, and even did some editing work to tidy up the final result.</p>
<p>In the video I walk through creating an RSS feed reader with Vue.js, and Netlify using their functions feature to deploy to AWS Lambda to fetch the feeds. Have a go if you&#8217;re interested and give me a shout if there&#8217;s any questions!</p>
