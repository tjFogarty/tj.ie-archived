I was having a read through some source code on a project and came across a reference to Avatars.io, which is a pretty nice service for fetching avatars. 

I'll be using this in future for something like Gravatar rather than having to hash an email and generate a link. For example I can do `https://avatars.io/gravatar/some@email.here`. If I wanted my Twitter avatar then it's `https://avatars.io/twitter/tj_fogarty`. It also supports Instagram, and Facebook.
