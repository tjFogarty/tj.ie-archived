<p>You&#8217;re speeding down the information highway during a blizzard. Data is pelting off your windscreen with reckless abandon. You stick your head out of the driver-side window to grab a glimpse of where you&#8217;re going, but you&#8217;re instantly blinded. There&#8217;s shards of data sticking out of your face while you fumble for an empty bottle to pee in since you can&#8217;t stop for fear of falling behind. It&#8217;s not pretty. It&#8217;s also a tad exaggerated.</p>
<hr />
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is sometimes it&#8217;s tough keeping up with what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;m making an effort to slow down, and learn at a comfortable pace. I try to imagine the world literally ending because I haven&#8217;t written a todo app with React, and it helps put things into perspective.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s a lot of resources here, they&#8217;re more of a starting point to focus on something that you find interesting. Here&#8217;s some resources that help me:</p>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts <a class="anchor" href="#podcasts" title="Podcasts">#</a></h2>
<p>I do love podcasts. They&#8217;re manageable bits and bytes of information that you can soak in at your own pace. Some of my favourites are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/" target="_blank">ShopTalk</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.laravelpodcast.com/" target="_blank">The Laravel Podcast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://toolsday.io/" target="_blank">Toolsday</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unfinished.bz/" target="_blank">Unfinished Business</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="screencasts">Screencasts <a class="anchor" href="#screencasts" title="Screencasts">#</a></h2>
<p>While podcasts are great for conversations surrounding interesting topics, you can&#8217;t beat watching and working with live code. That&#8217;s where screencasts shine, and when done right can spark some motivation.</p>

<h2 id="newsletters">Newsletters <a class="anchor" href="#newsletters" title="Newsletters">#</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;m finding myself signing up for more newsletters these days as they tend to reveal some really great articles that I would otherwise miss.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/subscription-options/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a> <small>I clearly have a bit of a gr√° for CSS-Tricks, and was fortunate enough to have an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/timber-and-twig-reignited-my-love-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">article</a> published there.</small></li>

<p>The nice thing about having access to all these resources is you can pick and choose what you find interesting. There&#8217;s no way you can read every article while listening to every podcast and watching every screencast. If you can, then fair play and power to you.</p>
<p>Massive thanks to all those who dedicate their time to provide these resources as well. It&#8217;s an incredible thing to be able to provide this knowledge.</p>
