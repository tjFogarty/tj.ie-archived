<p>A couple of years back, I began to let the waves of new tech wash over me, knowing the tide would go back out again. I started to relax a bit more, and accept that the stuff I knew was enough for what I needed. &quot;What&#8217;s the rush?&quot; For that, I count myself lucky. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say I stopped learning new things &#8212; far from it &#8212; but I came to accept that I&#8217;ll never know everything. I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over 10 years ago, and I&#8217;m still using them today. I&#8217;ll probably be using them for the next 10, too. All the while I&#8217;m tacking on new bits of experience and knowledge. Slowly but surely.</p>
<p>I found my work journal from a previous job, and it kinda shocked me the number of things I was doing on a given day. I never really stopped to assess what it would all lead towards, or how I could eventually spend that experience to sell my skills. For example, on one day I was working on 3 different projects, troubleshooting with clients, reviewing code, attending meetings, and writing a spec for an upcoming job. That&#8217;s a lot of stuff I would cast off as &quot;just work&quot;, before spending my nights tangled in envy at all the cool stuff people were building in the open-source world. I was envious because I filled all my social feeds with such amazing people, and I compared myself to them. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an internet-famous developer. I&#8217;m not a Vue or React expert. I haven&#8217;t created a library that&#8217;s used by thousands of developers.</p>
<p>But I know stuff. </p>
<p>If I hadn&#8217;t kept a log of my days, I don&#8217;t think I would have realised how much I&#8217;ve been exposed to and developed from. I can&#8217;t underestimate the value of writing stuff down with pen and paper. I don&#8217;t need to charge it, I don&#8217;t need to be connected to the internet. All I need is a few quiet minutes to reflect on my journey thus far. I can build a piece of software, and not understand every software engineering principle, but I&#8217;ll learn some more of them eventually with practice. Just because I can&#8217;t put an exact name to all the stuff I know, doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t know it, if that makes sense. Know what I mean?</p>
