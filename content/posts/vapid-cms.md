I recently gave Vapid a quick run-through, and it does what it says on the tin:

> Vapid is an intentionally simple content management system built on the idea that you can create a custom dashboard without ever leaving the HTML.

It parses your templates, and builds a dashboard based on the variables and sections you reference. It's sort of the opposite way we do things at the moment where you define your template variables first (think Advanced Custom Fields for WordPress), then reference those in your templates.

You can host it yourself (_nice_), or avail of their hosting when it becomes available. It'll be interesting to see the pricing structure for it, but I do think this is something agencies will latch on to thanks to the speed at which you can develop a site with it.
