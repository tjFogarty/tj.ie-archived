I recently took to redesigning my site a little bit after seeing some interesting things being done with typography. I just love big, bold type.

Now, I'm by no means a designer. I started out wanting to be one, but got lost in programming and forgot to leave some breadcrumbs down so I could find my way back. I could make things look alright-ish, and it would get the job done, but I never really gave it too much focus.

I'm still making things look _mostly_ alright, but trying to be more mindful as well. Below is how my site looks like right now. That is, this very second as I type. I tend to change things up frequently enough when I have some spare time to think.

First of all, shout out to {{< external-link href="http://helentran.com/" >}}Helen Tran.{{< / external-link >}} She recently redesigned her site which introduced me to the {{< external-link href="https://typekit.com/fonts/essonnes" >}}Essonnes{{< / external-link >}} font. Now, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about fonts, but I thought about this one for days, which is different for me. I visited the Typekit pricing page a number of times, and after a couple of days I went for it. That money should have gone into mortgage savings, and we'll say no more about it.

I copied things a bit, for sure, and I want to give credit where it's due. I'm still finding my feet with this stuff, and while I'm no-where close in terms of design capability, I'm eagerly trying things out in the hopes I can land on my own style.

Another site that reinforced my enjoyment of typography was the website for {{< external-link href="http://lucaorio.com/" >}}Luca Orio.{{< / external-link >}} There's something really clean, and crisp about it.

Long story short, I'm starting to care more about design. I'm trying things out while making & breaking my site. I'm always going to be a developer, but I hope, when all is said and done, that at least I can present my own code within a well-designed interface.
