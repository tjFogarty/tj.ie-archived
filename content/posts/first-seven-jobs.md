<p>Well, more like six-ish. If even.</p>
<p>When I first saw <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstsevenjobs?src=hash">#firstsevenjobs</a> my first thought was &quot;oh, I haven&#8217;t had that many jobs, I guess this isn&#8217;t for me&quot;. I suppose I took it a bit too literally.</p>
<p>Some of the jobs I have had were more short internships that I wouldn&#8217;t really count as a &quot;job&quot;. They were more like a baby-sitting exercise for someone else.</p>
<p>That being said, I figured I&#8217;d talk a bit about the experience I&#8217;ve had that led me to where I am at the moment.</p>

<p>I must have been about 12, or 13. I would cover for a friend of mine during the summer for a few years. I&#8217;d receive a couple of hundred bundled papers, divvy them up, and load them into my shoulder bag.</p>
<p>It was great pocket-money, and I got offered cigarettes in exchange for a paper from those not on my route. I&#8217;d politely decline as I wasn&#8217;t cool enough to smoke.</p>
<p>Any remaining papers would be dropped off at a local nursing home, and I&#8217;d receive my pay in a brown envelope. I think it was about 16 pounds. I was swimming in penny jellies and copies of Top Gear magazines.</p>

<p>In secondary school, we had two rounds of internships to do in 4th year. I applied to the Limerick Post, which was the paper I used to deliver.</p>
<p>I must have looked really important running around town in an oversized shirt with envelopes tucked under my arm. I remember one occasion I was bringing something to a hairdressers, and the owner greeted me with a great big smile, waving a scissors around. He thanked me for the envelope, and told me to get out.</p>

<p>For the second part of my work experience, I was working on a really old Mac, using Quartz and Photoshop. This was my first real taste of digital design, and I loved every moment of it. </p>
<p>My supervisor was explaining something to me once, and I had to stop and get a glass of water because I had lost vision in one of my eyes. Keep hydrated folks.</p>

<p>In college, we had 6 months work placement. At this point, I was undecided as to whether I would become a designer, or a developer. In my 6 months I got to experience both sides, and concluded that I loved developing. Even if I was fixing IE6 bugs, it was exciting to solve these kinds of problems.</p>

<p>Straight out of college I managed to land a job as a front-end developer. It began as an internship, but over the course of 2 years I had graduated to Lead Developer. This was a formative experience, and it really fuelled my passion for web development.</p>

<p>I finished my previous job on a Friday, and moved from Limerick to Waterford for my partner and a new job. I began work on the Monday. It&#8217;s been 2 years now, and it&#8217;s going great. Easily the best life/work decision I&#8217;ve ever made.</p>
